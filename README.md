### elevate folder

You will need to set a root folder where elevate will look for [**games**](#software-games), [**launchers**](#launchers-emulators-steam-etc), [**images**](#media-screenshots-etc) etc. 

Currently, elevate adheres to a strict directory layout to simplify development during alpha stages. Expect this to be more flexible in the future.

* \<elevate-dir\>: elevate's root directory **ex: C:\elevate**
	* \software: Game software (roms, exe, etc). See [software naming schemes](#)
    * \launchers: Emulators and other software launchers. See [launcher naming schemes](#)
    * \media: Screenshots and other imagery. See [media naming schemes](#)
    * \firmware: Platform BIOS and other firmware files.
    * \utilities: A few utility applications to help with launching

## Naming Schemes

### Software (games)

> Future releases will be less strict with software location

The software directory contains subfolders with the appropriate platform name (created during initial setup). *Games not placed in the appropriate platform subfolder will be ignored*

* \<elevate-dir\>\software
	* atari-2600
    * flash
    * nintendo-entertainment-system-nes
	* steam-win
    * win
    * zelda-classic
    * ..
    
Game software (roms, executables, etc) can be placed in its appropriate platform directory.

* \<elevate-dir\>\software\nintendo-entertainment-system-nes
	* super mario bros 3.nes
	* Kirby s Adventure (U) (PRG 1) [!].nes
    * ..
    
Game software can be named how ever you like, just make sure the appropriate extention is still there.

### Launchers (emulators, steam, etc)

> Caveat: For now, Steam **must** be installed in the \<elevate-dir\>\software\steam-win directoy.

Launchers are the applications that let you run games that cant be executed directly wether it be DRM or emulation.

> BizHawk launcher is downloaded and installed during setup

[List of supported launchers](#supported-launchers)

Directly under the launchers directory should place launchers with the folowing folder naming scheme:

\<launcherName\>\\\<release-os-arch\>

Example:

- \<elevate-dir\>\launchers
	- \BizHawk
    	- \1.11.6-win-x86
    	- \0.9.22-win-x86

Some games work better (or worse) on particular launcher releases (im looking at you [dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org))

If you dont care/want to deal with release directories just name one folder **latest** and place launcher files inside.

Example:

- \<elevate-dir\>\launchers
	- \BizHawk
    	- \latest
        	- EmuHawk.exe
            - ..

### Media (screenshots, etc)

> Media scanning is an early stage of development

Media files are the images that elevate will display for a particular game such as screenshots and box art.

#### Types (currently)

- Screenshot (Gameplay): Image of the game during gameplay 
- Screenshot (Title): Image of the game on its title/intro screen
- Posters: [example](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/b/bb/Metroid_fusion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120706064821): Any images related to the game in general but not necessarily the software. This could be wallpaper, ads, banners, posters, etc.

#### Naming

You can place media files directly under the media directory, using the naming convention below:

\<software-file-name\>.\<id\>.\<type\>.\<image-ext\>

- **software-file-name**: Full, identical name of the matching software *including its file extention*
- **id**: Optional. You can add any text here. This helps when you have more than one media file per game
- **type**: Media type, should be one of the following:
	- *scr*: In game screenshot
	- *tit*: Title or intro screenshot
    - *pos*: Poster style image
- **image-ext**: The image's file extention. Suppoted formats: .png, .gif, .jpg & .bmp

For example, if your game is named:

**Super Mario World (U)[!].sfc**

Then a screenshot can be added using the appropriate naming scheme:

**Super Mario World (U)[!].sfc.001.scr.png**
